Sentiment Analysis of a Facebook Page using Python(Vader)

I have analysed all the comments on the Facebook Page named MentalHealthAwarenessPakistan.
I have used VADER Librabry to get the polarity scores for each comment.
Identified the comments as positive,negative and neutral.

Visualized the count of positive, negative and neutral comments in a bar chart.
Also visualized the comments as positive, negative and neutral word clouds.
Also used Google Trans API to convert all the comments into English Language.
