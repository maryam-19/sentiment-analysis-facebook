Sentiment Analysis of a Facebook Page using Python(Vader)

First of all, I scrapped all the data(comments,replies & reactions) from the Facebook Page named MentalHealthAwarenessPakistan using Graph API Explorer V5.0.
Then stored all the data into a CSV file for further analysis.

I have then analysed all the comments on the Facebook Page named MentalHealthAwarenessPakistan.
I have used VADER Librabry to get the polarity scores for each comment.
Identified the comments as positive,negative and neutral.

Visualized the count of positive, negative and neutral comments in a bar chart.
Also visualized the comments as positive, negative and neutral word clouds.
Also used Google Trans API to convert all the comments into English Language.

This Project is for the Stanford CODE IN PLACE Program 2020.
